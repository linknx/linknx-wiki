# Source for the linknx Wiki

This repository contains the files used to publish the [linknx wiki](https://github.com/linknx/linknx/wiki).

The wiki itself is hosted in a separate repo which does unfortunately not support pull requests. Hence the present repository, being a clone of the wiki repo, whose `main` branch is automatically synchronized with the wiki's `master` branch via a [workflow](.github/workflows/wiki-sync.yml).

See [this page](https://github.com/linknx/linknx/wiki/Contributing#working-in-the-wiki) to learn how to contribute to this wiki.
