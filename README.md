# Source for the linknx Wiki

This repository contains the files used to publish the [linknx wiki](https://github.com/linknx/linknx/wiki).

The wiki itself is hosted on a [separate repo](https://github.com/linknx/linknx.wiki.git) which unfortunately does not support pull requests. Hence the present repository, being a clone of the wiki repo, whose `main` branch is automatically synchronized with the wiki's `master` branch via a [workflow](.github/workflows/wiki-sync.yml).

# How to Contribute

Proceed the same as with any Github repository: fork it and submit a pull request. We encourage any contributor to start with opening an issue describing the work about to be proposed in a pull request. Doing so, we have a chance to discuss the problems before the work is actually done.

## Guidelines

- US English only
- Abbreviations and acronyms are discouraged because they can be ambiguous. Their usage should be limited to those which are very common and unlikely to be misunderstood
- Code samples must be surrounded with backticks
